So this is the main body of the blog post.  It has an editor similar to the WordPress one.  Is using this netlifycms better than WordPress?  Perhaps, what features are we missing?  Environment Variables?  **Global Variables**?

The ability to set certain data pieces in one place and then reference them in multiple places is very powerful.  Any changes will only need to be made in one place.  That is very helpful with clients that move their office, change phone systems, etc.
